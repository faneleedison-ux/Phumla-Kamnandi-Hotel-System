# Phumla Kamnandi Hotel System
 
This project was undertaken as part of an Information Systems course and encompassed various phases, including system design, implementation, and testing. It involved creating a C# solution to address the unique challenges faced by the Phumla Kamnandi Hotel group.

The Phumla Kamnandi Hotel group, established in 2020, operates a diverse portfolio of 30 small hotels across South Africa, each operating independently. The absence of standardized hardware and software across these hotels led to operational difficulties, particularly in managing bookings efficiently.

The project was initiated with the objective of developing and implementing a new computer system across all 30 hotels. This system aimed to:

1. Enforce best practice business processes through software.
2. Establish a consistent and standardized appearance of accounts.
3. Implement uniform management and financial reporting practices across the group, simplifying data consolidation at both the hotel and group levels.
4. Reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO) related to hardware, software, and training for the entire group.

By undertaking this project, we sought to streamline operations, enhance efficiency, and promote consistency within the Phumla Kamnandi Hotel group, ultimately contributing to its growth and success.
